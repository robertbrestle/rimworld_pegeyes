  <description>Eye shot out? Vision not what it use to be? Yearning to complete your peg villagers with the appropriate body modifications? Look no further than a new pair of Peg Eyes!
  
Peg Eyes provide 5% sight efficiency, which is better than having no eyes at all!

They also come in 3 flavors:
- Peg Eyes = classic, wooden pegs for eyes
- Silver = a more refined take on eye hardware
- Golden = some serious eye candy!

Don't delay, install today!
